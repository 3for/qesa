/// The purpose of the mapping code is to map each message into the witness vector
/// 
/// What is a message?
/// A message is an element in a Pedersen commitment
/// For example, if P = aG + bH , then we have 2 messages `a` and `b`
/// 
/// In particular, we want to store three pieces of meta-data about a message; the commmitment_index, the position_in_witness and the commitment_crs_id
/// 
/// The `commitment_index` is the indice of the point that was used to commit that message
/// For example, Imagine we have a vector of points that we use to perform a Pedersen commitment `G`
/// We can commit to a commitment using P = a * G[0] + b * G[1] + c * G[2]
/// In this example, we have three message `a` , `b` and `c`. 
/// The commitment_index for `a` is `0` because we used the point at the 0th index from the vector of points `G`
/// 
/// The `position_in_witness` is a value that is computed `compute_mapping` 
/// It refers to an available position in the witness that this message can be placed into
/// This file only computes the mapping, Qesa_Copy places the messages in the relevant positions
/// 
/// The `commitment_crs_id` is the id of the set that was used to commit the message
/// In this proving system, one can commit using a continuos sequence of points: P = a * G[0] + b * G[1] + c * G[2]
/// Or you can commit to a combination of points: P = a * G[3] + b * G[5] + c * G[2] + d * G[4]
/// Therefore, when we commit messages we also need to specify what set of points are used to commit the message
/// This set is what we call a `commitment_crs` . In the above example, the commitment_crs would be {3,5,2,4}
/// The `commitment_crs_id` is number that refers to a specific `commitment_crs`. In particular, the `commitment_crs_id` for a specific message
/// is the id of the commitment_crs that was used to commit that message.
